    "<h3>1. Introduction</h3><br>\n",
    "The objective of this Project is to help people in exploring the neighborhood facilities. The project analyzes each neighborhood in the boroughs of Toronto for determining the salient features of each neighborhood. \n",
    "Many people migrate in the country due to reasons like new jobs, better health care, education etc. An individual often prefers to know what features are available in the selected community. Leveraging the data provided by FourSquare API this project aims at displaying most common venues in each borough along with the analysis of what is every neighborhood famous for, in each borough. \n",
    "Only knowing what a borough is famous for is not enough. In the bigger picture we can see what a borough's most important features are. However, the question is are these features of borough evenly available at each neighborhood in the borough? The answer is no. Hence it is also necessary to analyze the neighborhoods of each borough so that if an individual chooses to migrate to a borough we can recommend what neighborhood is better fit for him/her for better living."

Also, we modify the data by assigning empty neighborhoods to their corresponding boroughs. We can then visualize the data to determine what unique boroughs are there in Toronto. \n",

    "<b> Clustering Approach </b><br>\n",
    "We obtain the top venues for each neighborhood based on their frequency. Once we obtain this data, we can group these neighborhoods based on the characteristics of venues. We can now notice that unsupervised learning is required to perform the grouping preferred as we do not have any preclassified data of neighborhoods based on any characteristics. Hence, I choose to use k-means clustering approach to group these neighborhoods and find best fit for an individual based on his/her needs. "

For example, if I would like to move to a location with banks and food providers in the northyork borough, I will move to the neighborhood in cluster 2. "

    "\n",
    "In this project, using k-means cluster algorithm I separated the borugh's neighborhoods into 5 different clusters. \n",
    "We can observe from the results that if a student wants to rent a place with many of the most facilities being available the neighborhoods like \"Malvern, Rouge\", \"Rouge Hill, Port Union, Highland Creek\", \"Woburn\" belonging to \"cluster 1\" in Scarborough will be the best choice. Similarly if retired senior citizens would want to rent a place with not much noise around the place then neighborhood \"Guildwood, Morningside, West Hill\" from \"cluster 4\" in Scarborough neighborhood would be the best choice. \n",

    "<b>Future Works:</b><br>\n",
    "This project can be continued for making it more effective by considering may other factors available through premium calls to FourSquare API. This project can be used to build a recommender system with the selection criteria being the facilities required in the area of interest. "
