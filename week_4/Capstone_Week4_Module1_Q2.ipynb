    "<h4>Data source:</h4>\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\n",
    "The above page has a data table which has locations in the city of Toronto, in the province of Ontario. \n",

    "<h4>Foursquare API:</h4>\n",
    "This project would use Four-square API as its prime data source. Four-square API is an amazing data source which has databases of millions of places, their surrounding venues along with the user ratings, and many details about the businesses. Using credentials of Foursquare API features of near-by places of the neighborhoods would be mined. Due to http request limitations the number of places per neighborhood parameter would reasonably be set to 100 and the radius parameter would be set to 500.\n",

    "<h4>Clustering Approach:</h4>\n",
    "To compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like New York and Toronto. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm\n",
